            <p>The Where's Waldo series features a colorful cast of characters that have delighted readers for decades.
                From the titular hero Waldo to his quirky companions and clever adversaries, each character brings
                unique personality to the search-and-find adventure. Let's explore the main characters you'll encounter
                in your journey through Waldo's world.</p>

            <h2>Waldo - The Main Character</h2>
            <p>Waldo is the star of the show, instantly recognizable in his iconic red and white horizontal striped
                shirt, matching beanie cap, and round glasses. This world-traveling adventurer carries a walking stick
                and is known for his friendly demeanor and love of exploration. Waldo's distinctive appearance makes him
                both easy to spot and incredibly difficult to find among the crowded scenes.</p>

            <p>The character was created by British illustrator Martin Handford and first appeared in 1987. Known as
                "Wally" in the UK and many other countries, Waldo has become a cultural icon representing the joy of
                observation and discovery. His adventures take him through historical periods, exotic locations, and
                fantastical worlds, always getting lost in the crowd.</p>

            <h2>Wenda - Waldo's Friend</h2>
            <img src="images/wenda.png"
                alt="Where's Waldo characters Wenda - lady female companion wearing red and white striped outfit with camera and glasses"
                class="featured-image" style="max-width: 300px; float: right; margin: 0 0 1rem 1rem;" width="1024"
                height="1024" loading="lazy">
            <p>Wenda is Waldo's female companion and fellow traveler. She sports a similar red and white striped outfit
                but with her own unique style, typically wearing a skirt instead of pants. Wenda also wears round
                glasses and often carries a camera to document their adventures. She was introduced later in the series
                to provide Waldo with a traveling companion.</p>

            <p>Like Waldo, Wenda loves to explore and often appears in the same scenes, making fans search for both
                characters simultaneously. Her presence adds an extra layer of challenge and fun to the Where's Waldo
                books, encouraging readers to find multiple characters in each illustration.</p>

            <h3>Character Traits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adventurous spirit:</strong> Both Waldo and Wenda love traveling to new places</li>
                <li><strong>Friendly nature:</strong> They're always smiling and waving to readers</li>
                <li><strong>Curious explorers:</strong> They seek out the most interesting and crowded locations</li>
                <li><strong>Patient observers:</strong> They enjoy taking in all the details of their surroundings</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Wizard Whitebeard</h2>
            <img src="images/wizard.png"
                alt="Where's Waldo characters Wizard Whitebeard - magical wizard with white beard, red robes and scrolls to find"
                class="featured-image" style="max-width: 200px; float: right; margin: 0 0 1rem 1rem;" width="512"
                height="512" loading="lazy">
            <p>Wizard Whitebeard is easily identified by his flowing white beard and wizard's robes, typically in red
                and white stripes to match the series' theme. He carries a magical staff and appears throughout the
                books, adding a touch of fantasy and mysticism to Waldo's adventures. The wizard is known for hiding
                scrolls and magical items in each scene for readers to discover.</p>

            <p>Whitebeard serves as a mentor figure in the series, often appearing in the background of illustrations.
                Finding Wizard Whitebeard and his scrolls adds an additional search challenge beyond locating Waldo
                himself, rewarding careful observation and attention to detail.</p>

            <p>The wizard's magical elements bring an enchanting dimension to the Where's Waldo universe. His presence
                suggests that Waldo's adventures might involve more than just ordinary travel, hinting at mystical
                journeys through time and space. Collectors and dedicated fans particularly enjoy tracking down all of
                Wizard Whitebeard's hidden scrolls across the various books.</p>

            <h2>Odlaw - The Nemesis</h2>
            <img src="images/odlaw.png"
                alt="Where's Waldo characters Odlaw - nemesis villain wearing yellow and black striped outfit with mustache"
                class="featured-image" style="max-width: 200px; float: right; margin: 0 0 1rem 1rem;" width="512"
                height="512" loading="lazy">
            <p>Odlaw is Waldo's mischievous rival, wearing a distinctive black and yellow striped outfit that mirrors
                Waldo's red and white stripes. His appearance is deliberately opposite to Waldo's – a dark reflection of
                the hero. Odlaw sports a black mustache and often has a somewhat sneaky expression, befitting his role
                as the troublemaker of the series.</p>

            <p>While not exactly a villain, Odlaw represents the playful antagonist who enjoys causing harmless chaos
                wherever he goes. Spotting Odlaw in crowd scenes can be even more challenging than finding Waldo, as his
                darker colors can blend into shadowy areas or busy backgrounds. His presence adds narrative tension and
                excitement to the search.</p>

            <p>Odlaw's character design cleverly mirrors Waldo's while maintaining a distinct villainous edge. The
                yellow and black color scheme creates a striking visual contrast to Waldo's friendly red and white,
                immediately signaling his role as the mischievous counterpart. Finding Odlaw often requires searching
                the darker, more chaotic areas of each scene.</p>

            <h2>Woof - The Faithful Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/woof.png"
                alt="Where's Waldo characters Woof - loyal dog canine companion pet with red and white striped tail"
                class="featured-image" style="max-width: 300px; float: right; margin: 0 0 1rem 1rem;" width="512"
                height="512" loading="lazy">
            <p>Woof is Waldo's loyal canine companion, a small dog with distinctive features that make him another fun
                character to locate. In many books, only Woof's tail is visible, making him one of the hardest
                characters to spot. This clever twist challenges readers to think differently about what they're
                searching for.</p>

            <p>The adorable dog adds warmth and humor to the series. Woof represents loyalty and companionship, never
                straying far from Waldo even in the most crowded scenes. Finding Woof requires extra careful
                observation, as he's often partially hidden behind objects or people.</p>

            <h3>Other Recurring Elements</h3>
            <p>Beyond the main characters, Where's Waldo books feature numerous recurring background characters and
                objects that appear across multiple scenes and books. These include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The "Waldo Watchers" - a group of 25 Waldo fans who appear throughout the series</li>
                <li>Various objects and items specific to each book or scene</li>
                <li>Humorous background characters engaged in funny activities</li>
                <li>Historical and fantastical figures appropriate to each setting</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why These Characters Matter</h2>
            <p>The Where's Waldo characters have become beloved figures in popular culture, transcending their book
                origins to appear in television shows, video games, and countless references across media. Each
                character's distinctive design makes them instantly recognizable while still presenting a delightful
                challenge to locate in the detailed illustrations.</p>

            <p>These characters teach observation skills, patience, and the joy of discovery. Generations of children
                and adults have bonded over searching for Waldo and his friends, making them timeless figures in
                children's literature. The simple yet effective character designs demonstrate that great characters
                don't need complex backstories – sometimes, a distinctive outfit and a sense of adventure are all you
                need.</p>
