            <p>Whether you're a beginner or experienced searcher, these strategies will improve your Waldo-finding
                skills:</p>

            <h3>Systematic Searching</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grid method:</strong> Divide the image into sections and search each systematically</li>
                <li><strong>Edge-first:</strong> Start at the edges and work inward</li>
                <li><strong>Color scanning:</strong> Look specifically for red and white striped patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Eliminate crowds:</strong> Focus on less dense areas first, as Waldo often hides in moderate
                    crowds</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Look for Distinctive Features</h3>
            <p>Don't just scan for red stripes. Look for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The bobble on Waldo's hat</li>
                <li>Round glasses</li>
                <li>The walking stick</li>
                <li>Waldo's distinctive profile</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice Pattern Recognition</h3>
            <p>The more you play, the better you'll become at quickly eliminating similar-looking characters and
                focusing on likely hiding spots. Your brain develops pattern recognition skills that make each
                subsequent search faster.</p>
